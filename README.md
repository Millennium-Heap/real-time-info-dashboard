# real-time-info-dashboard
This project involves creating a dashboard that represents the status of a fictional manufacturing process.

We have the status contained in a text file with a day's woth of observations, one per second. Each observation includes a timestamp and the status of a several processes of that time.

We create a dashboard that shows the status of each processes at the current simulated time.
